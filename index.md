## Biography
I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Biological Sciences at Northern Kentucky University. My research is about Global Change Ecology. I'm interested in the spatial and temporal interactions between plants and the environment under the anthropogenic climate change. Specifically, my research focuses on the impacts from climate change on plant phenology and associated ecosystem processes. I use integrated approaches including herbarium specimens, field observation, remote sensing (ranging from time lapse cameras to Unmanned Aerial Vehicle systems (UAVs) and satellites), and statistical modeling to identify the mechanisms, patterns, forecasts, and consequences associated with plant phenology mainly in temperate biomes. I also enjoy working with students with diverse background to explore the fantastic nature. I'm excited to share my passion, knowledge, and experience to my students to inspire, guide and help them in their path of exploring, learning and developing.
